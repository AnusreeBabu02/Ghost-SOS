👻 Ghost SOS – Stealth Safety Companion

Ghost SOS is a discreet safety web application designed to help individuals — especially women — exit uncomfortable or potentially unsafe situations without drawing attention.

The app is cleverly disguised as a fully functional calculator. With a simple hidden trigger, it simulates a realistic incoming phone call, allowing the user to safely disengage from the situation.

🛡️ Problem Statement

In uncomfortable, unsafe, or high-pressure social situations, many individuals — particularly women — need a subtle and non-confrontational exit strategy.

Most safety apps are obvious and can escalate risk if noticed. There is a need for a stealth-first solution that works instantly without raising suspicion.

💡 Our Solution

Ghost SOS provides a hidden emergency mechanism disguised as an everyday calculator interface.

With a simple tap:

A stealth countdown begins

A realistic incoming call screen appears

Ringtone audio plays

User can “Accept” the call

Ongoing call simulation begins

User can safely exit the situation

All of this happens without revealing the true purpose of the app.
