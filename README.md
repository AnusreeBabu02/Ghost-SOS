# Ghost SOS - Stealth Safety App

**Ghost SOS** is a disguised safety tool designed for individuals in high-pressure or uncomfortable situations. It masquerades as a fully functional calculator, allowing users to discreetly trigger a realistic "Ghost Call" to provide a safe exit strategy.

## 📱 App Flow & Architecture


1.  **Home:** User opens the Calculator.
2.  **Trigger:** User taps a button; a 5-second timer begins.
3.  **Incoming:** `phone_call.jpeg` displays and `ringtone.mp3` plays.
4.  **Ongoing:** Upon clicking "Accept," the screen switches to `ongoing.jpeg` and `voice.mp3` plays.
5.  **Reset:** Clicking "Hang Up" stops all audio and resets the view to the Calculator.
