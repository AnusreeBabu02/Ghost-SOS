# Ghost SOS - Stealth Safety App

In uncomfortable, unsafe, or high-pressure social situations, many individuals — particularly women — need a subtle and non-confrontational exit strategy.
Most safety apps are obvious and can escalate risk if noticed. There is a need for a stealth-first solution that works instantly without raising suspicion.

**Ghost SOS** is a disguised safety tool designed for individuals in high-pressure or uncomfortable situations. It masquerades as a fully functional calculator, allowing users to discreetly trigger a realistic "Ghost Call" to provide a safe exit strategy.
